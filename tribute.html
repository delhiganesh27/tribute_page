        Karma Veerar Kamarajar is a leader remembered beyond the passage of time for his honest,
        dedicated service to the State of Tamil Nadu and our Nation – India. He, who is also called the
        Architect of Tamil Nadu, is the prototype of how a Political Leader should be. As the Chief Minister of
        Tamil Nadu, he brought so many developmental projects for the welfare of the state with main focus
        on Education.</p>

        <p>In order to motivate students from rural and economically weaker section of the society to
        come to schools, he not only re-opened the thousands of schools across Tamil Nadu that were
        closed due to certain reasons earlier, but also launched the mid-day meal program for the
        Government Schools which was a great success and is still in existence. The infrastructural
        developments, irrigation schemes, rural development works, dams and industries introduced during
        his tenure as Chief Minister are notable.</p>
       <p> Despite his committed services rendered to the people and the immense devotion he had on
        the Tamil soil and our Motherland – Bharat, people of Tamil Nadu did not give respect to this
        genuine personality and made him lose the election he contested in 1967. Well, leaving aside the
        politics of winning or losing, the point to ponder is that – Kamarajar devoted his entire life for Indian
        Independence, welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu, for the education of such children who
        otherwise could not have afforded the learning of Science, Maths and Language. He, who made
        every other household to have a water connection in their house but made his mother collect water
        from the common hand pump because he never used his position as Chief Minister for his personal
        benefits and he did not have sufficient money to buy the water connection. He, who fed so many
        children with his “Food for Education” scheme, such an uncorrupted person never bothered about
        his personal comforts and whose generation ended with his death at the age of 72 in 1975.</p>
        <p>Our school text books have lessons about Kamarajar. We remember this great leader on his
        birth and death anniversaries. Several events are conducted in his remembrance and several streets
        and places are named after him. But, have we created Kamarajars in our society in the past 46
        years? If our Educational Institutions have not created Kamarajars in our students, that implies the
        utter failure of the Educational System in Tamil Nadu.</p>
        <p>Mere production of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and doctors is not enough.
        Education should render the values of life as the core operator of all the fields of study. It is
        immaterial whether the student becomes a cab driver, runs a shop, takes over as a CEO of a
        Company or is an astronaut, the rightful manner and proper outlook with which they carry out their
        professions and jobs matter a lot to the society.</p>
        <p>Our Educational Institutions have to concentrate on the aspect of Value Education. Such
        Value Education which would give the older students who are writing their exams in online mode
        during this Covid pandemic, the guts to say ‘No’ to unfair methods of answering the questions. The
        value education should develop the self-disciplined insight in every learner to stand in a queue as a
        gesture of respecting the persons standing in front, wear the mask to avoid Corona infection and
        maintain social distancing; render the feeling that it is “my Country – my home and therefore I
        should not litter the roads instead, throw the wastes in the dustbin to keep my country clean”; and
        
        inculcate the self-control to not scribble in the walls of our ancient monuments and Temples. Our
        Education should create such strong leaders in politics like Kamarajar to govern the land and the
        people with the conviction that their function is to serve the people and not to sit as masters to
        command the public.</p>
       <p> On a whole, creating a corrupt-free society would be the greatest honor and tribute one
        would be giving to Karma Veerar Kumaraswami Kamarajar.</p>
